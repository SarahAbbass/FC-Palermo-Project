# FC-Palermo-Project

This project is part of EECE430 course.

This repository includes my own contribution to the project.
The main repository is on @EECE430-group1

A website for a football club (FC Palermo) that houses teams for individuals of different genders and age groups. Users will be able to access the website and register in order to receive or check any updates and news related to the team members. In addition to that, users may buy items from the club’s shop, buy tickets online, have access to the club’s archive and several other features.
